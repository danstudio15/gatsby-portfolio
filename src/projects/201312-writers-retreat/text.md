A brief was given with the aim of designing a small secluded structure on Cramond Island where a writer can come to work on a project with peaceful scenery and a distraction free environment. The response was to create a cuboid structure that leaned out toward the water, looking as though it was protruding out from the hillside. The top of this structure would be where the writer produces his work, and so windows were placed allowing views only of the water and the horizon as to not distract them.
