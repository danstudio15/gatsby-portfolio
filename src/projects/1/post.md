With a former people’s imperial power to the north and rising industrial complex to the east, Afghanistan finds itself too close to comfort with its ambitious neighbours, Russia and China, in the digital age.
<br/>
<br/>
In just about every hand or pocket is a smart phone, every house and office is armed with cutting edge laptop’s and the rumbling inertia of electric cars occupy more and more of our streets.
<br/>
<br/>
Laptop, car and machine are each a composite of lithium, copper, cobalt and more. Only ten years ago the idea of all of these being so common place lived in the not so distant realm of science fiction.
<br/>
<br/>
Consider how quickly our lives changed in the over the past ten years when the iPhone released in 2007, then imagine the demand after another ten. Afghanistan is sitting on $1 trillion worth of these materials.
<br/>
<br/>
Consumer demand for the ingredient behind our luxury tech isn’t going anywhere, but where are the minerals?
<br/>
<br/>
International expert and the man on the ground for a number of outlets, Tim Marshall is expecting China to be first in line to work with the Taliban to win international dibs on the essential minerals for the modern age.
<br/>
<br/>
He explained: “Most industrialised countries would like a slice of the mineral rights, but none as are well-positioned as China.
<br/>
<br/>
“The outside world needs to talk to the Taliban on a range of issues but the democracies will wait to recognise it as the legal and legitimate government until it gets some concrete action on getting their citizens out and on human rights.
<br/>
<br/>
“If they get them then recognition and the unfreezing of government funds should follow.”
<br/>
<br/>
Contrary to common consensus, Afghanistan is not ‘the graveyard of empires’ but rather the ‘highway of empires’ as, professor of anthropology at Boston University, Thomas Barfield teaches.
<br/>
<br/>
Empires from Alexander the Great, the Mongols through to powers of the modern day, each made their way through and successfully stayed in Afghanistan.
<br/>
<br/>
Less successful superpowers ruling over Afghanistan are more recent and empires in all but name. The Soviet Union and the United States, both are comprised of a multi-ethnic population, control some of the most powerful armies in history and hold territories from afar.
<br/>
<br/>
Now China, our most recent empire in all but name, has the opportunity to make its precession through Asia’s inter-continental roundabout of power. And it has the most gain in its ambitions.
<br/>
<br/>
Tim Marshall added: “In the event of a calm Afghanistan, which is far from certain, China stands to benefit more than Russia. It has a border with Afghanistan whereas Russia does not. 
<br/>
<br/>
“China is commercially interested in Afghanistan for two reasons: It wants the rare earth and other materials Afghanistan possesses. It would like the possibility of creating a corridor down to the port of Gwadar in Pakistan. China built the port as part of the B&R initiative.”
<br/>
<br/>
Now western powers are left with the challenge of how to work with the Taliban, uphold human rights and maintain the scales of power between China, while satisfying consumers demands for rare earth minerals.

I would also encourage anyone who wants to find our more, and more thoroughly, to listen to the many incredible lectures available online by professor Thomas Barfield online. “Afghanistan: A Cultural and Political History” is an excellent starting point: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6pJrlZg6BE

And for more on the recontextualization of empires in our modern age, Daniel Immerwahr’s talk, which shares the title of his book, ‘How to Hide an Empire’ is essential listening: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZaKOOqXDnqA&t=4s

Appendix:
<br/>
<br/>
I do not wish to propagate the propaganda, exercised by the Russian military by violations of air space and incursions into neighbouring territory, that their military is among the strongest in the world. With a military budget of $61.7 bn, compared the US air force’s alone of $204 bn, there is little comparison.
<br/>
<br/>
However, Russia is the country with the largest stockpile of nuclear weapons, making it one of the most potentially lethal countries in the world. This is why I considered it fair to include this moderate military power with that of the greatest forces in terms of size and combined arms.
