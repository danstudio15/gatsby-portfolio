The client is a startup business called brawler automotive design that designs, manufactures, and installs custom parts for 4×4 vehicles. The brands purpose is to produce vehicle parts that are simple and durable, with a clean stylish aesthetic. The client would like a logo designed for the brand that could be displayed on all vehicle parts made. The logo is to be: recognisable, readable from distance, clearly displaying the brands values, versatile for use on various sized and shaped vehicle parts, and stencilled as to be able to be laser cut.

The response is to first have the brand name written in sans-serif font denoting the brands clean, simple aesthetic. The brand name is written in bold and capital letters signifying the strength and durability of the vehicle parts. As a play on the word ‘brawler’, meaning someone who engages in rough fights, the letter ‘W’ is replaced with a stencilled fist, whereby the knuckles are read as forming a ‘W’. This stencilled fist can then also be used without the text on smaller vehicle parts and as an icon.
