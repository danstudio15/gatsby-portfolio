The aim was to design a data centre, located in Stornoway, Isle of Lewis, that incorporated a cohabitation strategy in order to integrate it better into the local community. This cohabitation strategy was to be formulated with regard to ways in which the data centre could be part of a wider territorial strategy. Following the growing awareness regarding the limited availability of fossil fuels, the data centre also had to integrate sustainability strategies and renewable energy into its design, as to minimize its effect on the environment. In addition, this project focused on the use of digital techniques in design, fabrication and presentation.
