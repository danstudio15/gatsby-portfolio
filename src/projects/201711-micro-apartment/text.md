The design aims to create a modern four-person family home in 50 sqm, yet does not feel claustrophobic, gimmicky, or sacrifices in spacial quality. This is achieved by making sure that every column of space within the modular apartment has more than one singular function. Multiple functions have been achieved either by stacking spaces or by creating flexible spaces that provide various functions within the same space. The apartment itself is also fairly modular, as the space is split into two separate zones by a unit that houses all private functions that require nonflexible dedicated floor space, such as bedrooms, bathroom and kitchen. This modularity inside the apartment allows for this concept to be applied to other apartments, regardless of variations in size.
