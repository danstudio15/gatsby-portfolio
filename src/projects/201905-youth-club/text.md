Govan has many issues, a major one being its youth. There is a prevalent gang culture among young teens that has led to increased street violence and vandalism in the area. The Lyceum is a derelict site with a rich history and large cultural significance in Govan and Glasgow. It is located on a prominent corner site in the centre of Govan and is category B listed due to its art deco facade. The Govan Youth Information Project (GYIP) are a nonprofit organisation that aims to educate, improve living standards and prospects of young people in Govan. They are currently short on space and facilities and so want a new building that remedies this and can help aid conversations between youths and support workers. The main criterion is that it must be informal in nature and entice in the particularly vulnerable youths as opposed to those that are not.

The response creates an indoor street laid along an urban landscape, keeping the majority of the existing facade. This forms two entrances, one for locals and another for non-locals approaching from the proposed new bridge. The whole site is then covered by a canopy held by leaning columns.
