With a reflexive reaction, Mike Mitchell raised his head from his steering wheel and turned towards his right, revealing what was left of his passenger seat. In its place lay the front of another car, mixed up peacefully with bits of cloth, glass and torn aluminium from his own car as steam rose from the now crooked bonnet. The car stared back with mocking grimace. Then, just like the two cars, his face began to crumple. Mike focused his eyes on those of the other driver through the kaleidoscopic windshield.
<br/>
<br/>
None of this put his radio to a stop though. As though nothing had changed, the local radio station called out: “Twenty-five, forty-two, zero, eleven, nine, eighty and twenty-four.
<br/>
<br/>
“If these are your numbers, then congratulations, you’re our lucky winner. You just won a new car!”
<br/>
<br/>
A pain stuck Mike as the irony hit him: “Friday night and just my luck. Some bastard just won his dream car mine’s totalled.”
<br/>
<br/>
With a small tear on the verge of escaping down his face, nothing more than a deep grunt emanated  from his tense chest as his body collapsed forward into his seat belt. Slowly releasing his tight grip on the worn steering wheel, he felt his way to the door handle and took a step out to confront the driver who joined their cars in unison. After pointlessly exchanging insurance information and waiting for the police to clear the scene – only after they wrote Mike a £100 bill for shifting what’s left of his car – Mike set off for town before catching a bus back home.
<br/>
<br/>
The sickly orange lights of ‘Deborah’s Downtown Kitchen’ eamed out onto the slippery streets. The glow reflected beneath Mike’s tired face. A greasy smell clung onto Mike’s jacket as an older-looking Deborah welcomed him in. It wasn’t the first time he’d been here under such circumstances.
<br/>
<br/>
“What are you doing here at this time of night? I’m just closing up.” said Deborah, with a glass and dishtowel in hand.
<br/>
<br/>
“I was in a car crash.”
<br/>
<br/>
“Oh, you poor thing” answered Deborah as she pointed to a red and white checkered tablecloth draped over a table for one.
<br/>
<br/>
“Are you alright? You don’t look too bad.”
<br/>
<br/>
“No, I’m okay thanks. But I don’t think I can pay for it.”
<br/>
<br/>
“It’s Friday, isn’t it payday?” “I might hurt but surely that will cover it?”
<br/>
<br/>
“Yeah, I’ve got my cheque here, but the bank closed at four today anyway. I’ll have to wait until Monday lunchtime to cash it. Even then, it won’t be until Wednesday before it clears and then I’ll have to go back on Thursday to pick it up.”
<br/>
<br/>
“Then there’s the hundred quid fee from the police waiting for me to pay for the recovery. Once rent comes out I’ll be back to square one and it’ll be another month before I can think about paying for the bloody thing.”
<br/>
<br/>
“What will I do with it now? It’s easier just to scrap it. Could go towards a new one.”
<br/>
<br/>
“It’s got to be pretty pricy buying a new car each month Mike.”
<br/>
<br/>
“Aye, but I can’t afford a new one. So, I’ll just have to wait until I find the next shitbox.”
<br/>
<br/>
Deborah, reeled back a bit. Disapproving of his language. Though she hardly showed it.
<br/>
<br/>
“Well, how about insurance, I hope you weren’t driving without it.”
<br/>
<br/>
“No, no. But I only had the cheap stuff, I know they just won’t cover it.”
<br/>
<br/>
“That’s awful Mike. What a way to end the week.”
<br/>
<br/>
“I know, I thought I was on top of it. The council just moved me into the new part of town. You know, the social housing.”
<br/>
<br/>
“Oh, well that’s something. How is it?” replied Deborah, grasping for the bright side.
<br/>
<br/>
“It’s not bad, not bad. But of course, it doesn’t come with a washing machine.”
<br/>
<br/>
“Well, how are you supposed to do your laundry? I bet you’ll need a spin after every shift in the warehouse.”
<br/>
<br/>
“Yeah, you’re right, I do. But it would probably cost fifty pence or so for a spin at home. But the laundrette charges a fiver per spin.”
<br/>
<br/>
With a weariness starting to set in after her own long day at work, Deborah said, Oh come on, you need to start looking on the bright side.”
<br/>
<br/>
“It’s hard when you’re living this life.” replied Mike.
<br/>
<br/>
Deborah’s door closed behind him as he walked out with a cold roll and sausage in hand, it was all that was left in the grill after she closed up. Mike wiped his fingers on the paper foil wrapper and leaned into the bin to throw it away once he finished on his way to the bus. Still feeling weary after a day at work, the crash and his walk, suddenly caught up with Mike and he lost his balance. His hand fell into the bin, then his fingers slipped and grabbed onto a thin cardboard. He drew his hand out from the bins mouth, and with it this colourful note which read:
<br/>
<br/>
25 – 42 – 0 – 11 – 80 – 84
<br/>
<br/>
He won. He had in his very own hands the ticket to tonight’s local lottery. That new car was his!
<br/>
<br/>
The weekend washed over him after he phoned the station. Mike took the day off work, for the first time in his life Mike had won. Donning his best shirt, he made his way to the station. Closing the heavy door behind him and walking into what would have been an extravagant reception in the 70s, Mike met with the station manager to pick up the keys to his new Sangrano. Rather sheepishly as his eyes darted to the ground, the manager looked up to say, “Now there’s just one more thing for you to sign Mr Mitchell.”
<br/>
<br/>
“It’s the gift tax on this, you’re going to have to pay ten thousand pounds in tax before we can give this to you.”
<br/>
<br/>
“He who has everything, more will be given. He who has nothing, everything will be taken.”
