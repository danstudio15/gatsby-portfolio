Britain’s signed up for hosting the biggest summit in its history, COP26, inviting 197 international states with 25,000 delegates into town.
<br/>
<br/>
The British Government, under a Conservative administration, also have to keep locals and voters happy.
<br/>
<br/>
Is it possible to create a safe and enjoyable time without disrupting the lives of locals and potential voters?
<br/>
<br/>
Arguably not. Between the tight security, civil disorder, and protesters it’s very hard to get away with not disturbing someone’s day.
<br/>
<br/>
There’s not much information out there on how the decision process came about choosing Glasgow as the host for the major conference. So, bear with me as I make my inferences from the information available.
<br/>
<br/>
Scotland is the obvious choice for taking the lead in hosting, most of the country’s electricity comes from renewable power – 68.1% of consumed energy is renewable and 71% of that power comes from onshore wind turbines – and the two major cities, Glasgow and Edinburgh, top the rankings for Greenest City in the UK.
<br/>
<br/>
Glasgow’s event space, the SEC (Scottish Events Campus), is much larger than Edinburgh’s own EICC (International Conference Centre). The main exhibit hall floor in the SEC is 251,391 sq ft., whereas the EICC is 110,000 sq. ft big.
<br/>
<br/>
The SEC is also in a far more easily isolated area of Glasgow with a river to the south and access from the north coming from both East and West, only two sides of the centre – with Finnieston Street being the most restricted – needed to be cut off. Compared to the, densely packed, surrounding streets of Edinburgh’s city centre.
<br/>
<br/>
The COP26 website explains: “The ‘Dear Green Place’ is the perfect place to host a sustainable and inclusive COP. It has set a target for carbon neutrality by 2030, aims to be one of the greenest cities in Europe through its Sustainable Glasgow campaign, and is 4th in the world in the Global Destination Sustainability Index.
<br/>
<br/>
There’s the bright side, Scotland’s a green country with a reputation worth championing. Then Glasgow’s Global Green City status compliments the central message of working with the environment.
<br/>
<br/>
But I think there’s more to the story. Consider London, the last global climate conference took place in Paris, the very heart of France. Why didn’t the British Government go with the same idea?
<br/>
<br/>
In my view, COP26 is something that’s happened to Glasgow and not for it or with it.
<br/>
<br/>
How so? Before it started, the conference created a clear divide between the everyday person and international elite, industrial action is holding the city ransom and day to day lives are being disrupted in a myriad of ways.
<br/>
<br/>
For years Glaswegians have called for a London style ‘oyster card’ to take advantage of the plentiful infrastructure links in the city. For COP26’s participants, this was sorted for them. But the people who make Glasgow, the wait will have to continue.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This was the first split between Glaswegians and the high society politicians invited into the city. Once the conference went into swing, this divide widened with the royal banquet.
<br/>
<br/>
That was held just three streets away, but through a central artery of Glasgow’s West End, and ended up closing off the whole route between the SEC and Glasgow’s Kelvingrove Art Gallery.
<br/>
<br/>
Even a pedestrianised road was closed to ‘traffic including walkers, wheelers & cyclists’ to make way for the world’s wealthiest and most influential leaders to enjoy their dinner, forcing walkers – the most environmentally friendly commuters- to make a diversion or to cut through Glasgow’s largely unlit Kelvingrove Park.
<br/>
<br/>
(In all fairness, lights were put up throughout Kelvingrove Park – which ran on individual generators – but they left a lot to be desired.)
<br/>
<br/>
Now, I don’t want to get into the merits of the strike action taking place in Glasgow. My point is not if they should or should have taken, but the impact the decision – whether right or wrong – is making.
<br/>
<br/>
In a pay dispute, RMT (National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers) warned that ‘total inaction by Transport Scotland (Scottish Government) and Abellio compromises looming major events [COP26].’
<br/>
<br/>
They held the Scottish Government at ransom in the hopes of better pay and reconsidered hours.
<br/>
<br/>
A strike during the largest climate conference since Paris is not an option for the government, so ScotRail explained the situation was resolved by: “A payment of £300 to all staff ensuring COP26 is fully supported.” 
<br/>
<br/>
Ian McConnell, ScotRail Chief Operating Officer, said: “We look forward to Scotland’s Railway playing its part in delivering a successful COP26 next week.”
<br/>
<br/>
But Glasgow is also run by the SNP, and unlike the Scottish Government, they’ve failed to prevent a strike at the heart of the city’s cleanliness.
<br/>
<br/>
Now Glasgow’s binmen are on strike with their sights set on embarrassing the city into better pay. They’re looking for a pay rise of 5.89%.
<br/>
<br/>
Louise Gilmour, GMB Scotland Secretary, said: “The council has failed to give our members the proper time and space to consider the 11th-hour offer from COSLA, and the fact the council moved to block strike action in the Court of Session using anti-trade union legislation, means there is too much bad faith among members towards the employer.”
<br/>
<br/>
This completely plays into the Conservatives in Westminster’s hands. Scotland takes on all the risk of hosting the international conference – disrupted voting base, union strikes and takes on a massive security and logistical operation – while the central government takes home the prize a global climate leader.
<br/>
<br/>
But the conference has not been totally alienating for local people. While the droning helicopters overhead each day have taken their toll, the numerous protests have given everyone a chance to have their say.
<br/>
<br/>
Over 100,000 people marched alongside Greta Thunberg through the town on Saturday (November 6), making themselves seen from east to west in their precession.
<br/>
<br/>
Much of the town was cut off for ordinary people. People trying to drive through or cross the streets, even leading to some train disruption. But, at the end of the day, a protest is meant to stir up disorder.
<br/>
<br/>
It’s not an earthquake or other natural disaster, but it does feel Glasgow is paying the price of admission while the national government walk away as leading the climate agenda after paying very little of the price and taking home the reward.
