The project aims to be a multiplayer parkour game, where the player's agile movements through an highly-vertical, open world allow them to take down enemies much greater than them. The project is inspired by some of my favourite video games and TV shows. The movement, overall feel and the basis for the kinds of activities players will participate in is influenced heavily by Jet Set Radio Future and Hover Revolt of Gamers. Since there is an emphasis on the player traversal and use of parkour, Mirrorâ€™s Edge and Titanfall have also had a strong impact on the gameplay. The various powers and abilities in the game have mainly taken inspiration from anime and comics, such as Spider-man, Attack on Titan, and My Hero Academia.
